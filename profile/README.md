# 🚀 ChicBase: The Modular Flutter Architecture for Building Multiple Apps

## 🎯 What is ChicBase?

**ChicBase** is a revolutionary modular architecture system that enables teams to build and maintain multiple Flutter applications efficiently by sharing a common codebase while preserving each app's unique identity.

Think of it as a **"franchise model" for mobile app development"** - you get a proven foundation with shared components, but each app maintains its own branding, features, and personality.

### 💡 The Problem ChicBase Solves

Traditional app development approaches face these challenges:
- **Code Duplication**: Building similar apps means rewriting the same features
- **Maintenance Nightmare**: Bug fixes must be applied to each app individually
- **Slow Development**: Each new app starts from scratch
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Different implementations of the same features

ChicBase solves all these problems through intelligent code sharing and modular architecture.

## 🏗️ How ChicBase Works

ChicBase separates your Flutter app into **6 strategic modules**, divided between shared infrastructure and app-specific customizations:

### 📦 Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Your Flutter App                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🎯 App-Specific Layer (Your Organization)              │
│  ├── minibase/     → App entry point & configuration    │
│  ├── skeleton/     → Custom UI, screens & navigation    │
│  └── metadata/     → Assets, texts & app settings       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  📦 Shared Foundation (Chic-Base Organization)          │
│  ├── base/         → Core business logic & models       │
│  ├── superbase/    → Reusable UI components            │
│  └── sharedkernel/ → Utilities, analytics & services    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🔄 The Power of Code Reuse

When you update a payment module in `base/`, ALL your apps get the improvement automatically. When you fix a bug in a shared UI component in `superbase/`, every app benefits instantly. This is the magic of ChicBase!

## 📊 Module Breakdown

### 🌐 **Shared Modules** (Maintained by Chic-Base)
*Write once, use everywhere - these modules power ALL apps*

| Module | Purpose | Contents |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **base** | Core business logic | • Data models<br>• API services<br>• Business rules<br>• Authentication |
| **superbase** | Shared UI components | • Common screens<br>• Reusable widgets<br>• Theme systems<br>• Navigation patterns |
| **sharedkernel** | Cross-cutting utilities | • Analytics<br>• Preferences<br>• Ad integration<br>• Helper functions |

### 🎨 **App-Specific Modules** (Maintained by You)
*Customize these for each individual app*

| Module | Purpose | Contents |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **minibase** | App configuration | • App ID & bundle<br>• Build settings<br>• Main entry point<br>• App-specific dependencies |
| **skeleton** | Custom UI & features | • App screens<br>• Custom navigation<br>• Branding elements<br>• Unique features |
| **metadata** | App resources | • Translations<br>• Images & assets<br>• Configuration files<br>• App-specific data |

## 🚀 Real-World Example

Imagine you're building apps for different restaurant chains:

1. **Shared Foundation (Chic-Base)**:
   - Order management system
   - Payment processing
   - User authentication
   - Common UI components (buttons, forms, etc.)

2. **App-Specific Customization**:
   - **Pizza Place App**: Red theme, pizza menu, special offers
   - **Burger Joint App**: Yellow theme, burger menu, loyalty program
   - **Sushi Bar App**: Minimalist theme, sushi menu, reservation system

All three apps share the same robust foundation but look and feel completely different!

## 🛠️ ChicBase Development Tools

ChicBase provides automated tools to set up your development environment quickly:

### 📦 Available Scripts

| Script | Use Case | What It Clones |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| `clone_app.sh` | Full app development | All 6 modules (complete environment) |
| `clone_skeleton.sh` | UI/UX development | Only UI-related modules |
| `clone_superbase.sh` | Shared component development | Component development modules |

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the ChicBase tools
git clone git@github.com:Chic-Base/clone-tools.git
cd clone-tools
chmod +x *.sh

# Choose your development scenario:
./clone_app.sh YourOrgName        # Full app development
./clone_skeleton.sh YourOrgName   # UI customization only
./clone_superbase.sh YourOrgName  # Shared component development
```

---

## 👨‍💻 Development Workflows

### 1️⃣ **"I'm building a complete app"**
You need all modules to build and test the full application:
```bash
./clone_app.sh YourOrgName
```

### 2️⃣ **"I'm customizing the UI"**
You only need the UI layer and configuration:
```bash
./clone_skeleton.sh YourOrgName
```
This gives you:
- `skeleton/` - Edit the UI freely
- `metadata/` - Customize assets and config
- `sharedkernel/` - Use shared utilities (read-only)

### 3️⃣ **"I'm building shared components"**
You're creating features for ALL apps:
```bash
./clone_superbase.sh YourOrgName
```
This gives you:
- `superbase/` - Build shared components
- `metadata/` - Test configurations
- `sharedkernel/` - Use core utilities (read-only)

## 📚 Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup over scripts:

1. Create your app folder:
```bash
mkdir YourAppName && cd YourAppName
```

2. Clone app-specific modules:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:YourOrg/minibase.git
git clone git@github.com:YourOrg/skeleton.git
git clone git@github.com:YourOrg/metadata.git
```

3. Clone shared modules:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Chic-Base/base.git
git clone git@github.com:Chic-Base/superbase.git
git clone git@github.com:Chic-Base/sharedkernel.git
```

⚠️ **Important**: Keep exact folder names (`minibase`, `skeleton`, etc.) as the modules use relative imports.
